            <title><![CDATA[Minimalism equals freedom]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Minimalism equals freedom</h1><p>On the surface, minimalism seems like an ascetic lifestyle. One mistakenly imagines that minimalists are the type to live out in the desert with a jug of water and a packet of crackers with nature to entertain them. This version of minimalism is a rather extreme version. However, that is not to say that the ascetic is not experiencing his version of freedom.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/4a7c4992-dd4d-40a5-af95-232b90aa9105.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>First night with Vibram Five Finger Shoes</h1><p>Today, I received the shipment of my new Vibram Five Finger shoes. This model is the Spyridon MR Trail Running Shoe, which I purchased from Amazon. Although I am not yet a runner, let alone a trail runner, I expect to eventually be one.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6b60c938-6018-493b-af0d-4455b6b596a5.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Getting Rid of Just-in-Case Items: 20 Dollars, 20 Minutes | The Minimalists</h1><p>We often hold on to things just in case we need them: We don't let go because we might need something in some far-off, nonexistent, hypothetical future. We pack too much stuff in the remotest chance we might need something for trips and vacations.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/2b2431f8e7ba7b0/e3ac860cac22e06d8c54e38965497573/noop.jpg?input=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theminimalists.com%2Ffiles%2F2011%2F12%2FGirl-and-Doll.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Freedom From Politics]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Freedom From Politics</h1><p>It is possible to have peace and freedom in your life despite who is in elected office. Having worked in politics, there was some uneasiness I had when I was in the thick of it. It can be fun and fascinating; but, I didn’t really feel like I was making much of a difference in the lives of the people over whom I helped make policy. I later realized what was causing me the unrest.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6cb68fde-b883-4a54-8a5e-693c46bd2d9d.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Barefoot Running and Health Freedom]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Barefoot Running and Health Freedom</h1><p>I was not quite sure how to tie in barefoot running with freedom, except that I am trapped by an accident I had as a teenager. I had a motorcycle accident which has left me with lingering problems on one leg. I can function well enough except that strenuous walking and, especially, running starts to cause discomfort. I would like to run. I used to love running. But, I am trapped by a leg that will not tolerate it for very long. </p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/41dda9eb-01a4-4b51-b515-4d0b59bd155d.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[False Freedom: Don’t fool yourself]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>False Freedom: Don’t fool yourself</h1><p>You work hard, make money, establish systems, and do everything possible to create a future built around your freedom. It turns out that freedom is subjective; it is different for everybody. So, I started thinking about what freedom is not and how some freedom can be false. So, let’s talk about false freedom.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/5d78d33f-5e7f-4915-9ff1-f023bf679710.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[What is your story of freedom?]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>What is your story of freedom?</h1><p>One challenge to seeking freedom is figuring out to what purpose? What does it look like and how do you get it? I have discovered that storytelling is one way to find freedom. How would you characterize yourself if you were the protagonist in your own story?</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/4f606446-099d-4bd1-a89a-f42dc800aaa3.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Book Review: The 10X Rule</h1><p>I finished reading The 10X Rule: The Only Difference Between Success and Failure last week. Grant Cardone has done a great job with this book, although at the end it was a bit self-congratulating. I have a ton of highlights through most of the book, however. I think this book is definitely one for your Freedom Library.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a99606e7-5e3a-42be-8ac9-195b70a3d9f4.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Book Review: The End of Jobs</h1><p>I have put off writing about this book, The End of Jobs, because I am conflicted about it. I find value in what Taylor Pearson writes. However, I have read many of the same books from which he derives the material written in his book. It is fair to say that The End of Jobs is a derivative work.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/535943d7-167d-423d-bd76-249696dbddbf.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Work: When it rains it pours</h1><p>The good news is that I start a new full-time job soon. This means that I need to finish whatever side jobs I have pending so that I can focus on getting oriented with the new position. I am pending drug test and background check before getting started. </p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ec525fb2-e208-46d6-8e38-fbc05e3e68d4.jpg"></article>]]></description>
