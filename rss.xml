            <title><![CDATA[Book Review: The 10X Rule]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Book Review: The 10X Rule</h1><p>I finished reading The 10X Rule: The Only Difference Between Success and Failure last week. Grant Cardone has done a great job with this book, although at the end it was a bit self-congratulating. I have a ton of highlights through most of the book, however. I think this book is definitely one for your Freedom Library.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a99606e7-5e3a-42be-8ac9-195b70a3d9f4.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Book Review: The End of Jobs]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Book Review: The End of Jobs</h1><p>I have put off writing about this book, The End of Jobs, because I am conflicted about it. I find value in what Taylor Pearson writes. However, I have read many of the same books from which he derives the material written in his book. It is fair to say that The End of Jobs is a derivative work.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/535943d7-167d-423d-bd76-249696dbddbf.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Work: When it rains it pours</h1><p>The good news is that I start a new full-time job soon. This means that I need to finish whatever side jobs I have pending so that I can focus on getting oriented with the new position. I am pending drug test and background check before getting started. </p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ec525fb2-e208-46d6-8e38-fbc05e3e68d4.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Transition to Writing</h1><p>Originally, I had intended to become a self-supporting writer with the purpose, firstly, of becoming self-supporting. I see writing as the ultimate home-based business. I imagine myself secluded in a corner somewhere with coffee and a laptop banging away on the QWERTY, making money.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fce60c8c-00ca-4c4f-857d-f299f0898fb7.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[The Trouble With Freedom]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Trouble With Freedom</h1><p>The theme for this period in my life is “Seeking Freedom”. Instinctively, I know that this is something I want. Cognitively, I do not fully grasp what that means. Being Free is turning out to be a great more difficult than I thought. The problem is choosing one of many paths.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/12a60ecb-4e11-4366-9ea6-9c113992ca11.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Shaine Lee Mata: Experiment in Self-Banking</h1><p>In the past few months, I have been experimenting with self-banking. The idea is to have some money saved away, which I can borrow. After borrowing the money, I run it through a 1 year amortization, or longer. Then, I pay back the loan to my savings with interest.</p></article>]]></description>
