            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Young, Broke, and Scared of the IRS: The Millennial Tax Trap</h1><p>It wasn't a very nice way to begin a letter, but then, it was from the Internal Revenue Service, and it got Greg's attention. The Athens, Georgia, veteran said the notice, which arrived earlier this year, cited three months of taxes he had failed to pay two years ago-and was the first he'd heard of it.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4b88874733c93e0bf4db2e0b0dfe0c91029b8883.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Why smart people are better off with fewer friends</h1><p>Hell might actually be other people -- at least if you're really smart. That's the implication of fascinating new research published last month in the British Journal of Psychology. Evolutionary psychologists Satoshi Kanazawa of the London School of Economics and Norman Li of Singapore Management University dig in to the question of what makes a life well-lived.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/39f52f2c12afc16968d525d0352a71575b0432df.jpg"></article>]]></description>

It turns out that one flaw in the process is me. It has become habitual to check balances, transfer money, schedule payments, and figure out strategies to ensure what needs to be paid gets paid.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/ee584e93cc5088e415b4a6c29ac3716451b66fc6.gif"></article>]]></description>
