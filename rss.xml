            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>First Run In Vibram Five Fingers</h1><p>Tonight, I had my first run in Vibram Five Finger shoes. It was more of a series of short jogs. The park I frequent is one square block. I ran one side, walked the next, ran, and walked. This went on for thirty minutes.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/73fc36b6-fa75-492a-be90-5943d6f93fdd.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Quit Social Media. Your Career May Depend on It.</h1><p>I'm a millennial computer scientist who also writes books and runs a blog. Demographically speaking I should be a heavy social media user, but that is not the case. I've never had a social media account. At the moment, this makes me an outlier, but I think many more people should follow my lead and quit these services.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/2b2431f8e7ba7b0/205191f89085224d5dc355b3128d57ca/noop.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic01.nyt.com%2Fimages%2F2016%2F11%2F20%2Fbusiness%2F20PRE%2F20PRE-facebookJumbo.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Outsourced Thinking]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Outsourced Thinking</h1><p>Recently, I asked my assistant to spend some time thinking about blog topics for me. Lately, I have been in a doing mode, not too much about the thinking, at least in my personal life. Consequently, things at work are going great when I am fresh and ready to think. But, I am fried at the end of the day with little thinking capacity left for home. So, I need some pre-thinking done.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b7072146-8036-4109-ba32-97afe9ed9fc6.png"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Minimalism equals freedom]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Minimalism equals freedom</h1><p>On the surface, minimalism seems like an ascetic lifestyle. One mistakenly imagines that minimalists are the type to live out in the desert with a jug of water and a packet of crackers with nature to entertain them. This version of minimalism is a rather extreme version. However, that is not to say that the ascetic is not experiencing his version of freedom.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/4a7c4992-dd4d-40a5-af95-232b90aa9105.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>First night with Vibram Five Finger Shoes</h1><p>Today, I received the shipment of my new Vibram Five Finger shoes. This model is the Spyridon MR Trail Running Shoe, which I purchased from Amazon. Although I am not yet a runner, let alone a trail runner, I expect to eventually be one.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6b60c938-6018-493b-af0d-4455b6b596a5.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Freedom From Politics]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Freedom From Politics</h1><p>It is possible to have peace and freedom in your life despite who is in elected office. Having worked in politics, there was some uneasiness I had when I was in the thick of it. It can be fun and fascinating; but, I didn’t really feel like I was making much of a difference in the lives of the people over whom I helped make policy. I later realized what was causing me the unrest.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6cb68fde-b883-4a54-8a5e-693c46bd2d9d.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Barefoot Running and Health Freedom]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Barefoot Running and Health Freedom</h1><p>I was not quite sure how to tie in barefoot running with freedom, except that I am trapped by an accident I had as a teenager. I had a motorcycle accident which has left me with lingering problems on one leg. I can function well enough except that strenuous walking and, especially, running starts to cause discomfort. I would like to run. I used to love running. But, I am trapped by a leg that will not tolerate it for very long. </p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/41dda9eb-01a4-4b51-b515-4d0b59bd155d.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[False Freedom: Don’t fool yourself]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>False Freedom: Don’t fool yourself</h1><p>You work hard, make money, establish systems, and do everything possible to create a future built around your freedom. It turns out that freedom is subjective; it is different for everybody. So, I started thinking about what freedom is not and how some freedom can be false. So, let’s talk about false freedom.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/5d78d33f-5e7f-4915-9ff1-f023bf679710.jpg"></article>]]></description>
