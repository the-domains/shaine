This used to be called being stuck in a rut. I disagree with the description. You create a rut from walking or driving the same path over and over. Despite the negative association, a rut is the result of purpose.</p>]]></description>

I felt like, somehow, I had reached the end of a phase and had to step up to the next level. I could not pinpoint exactly what actions or circumstances created this sense of . . . building. It is as if I am not done expanding. </p>]]></description>

I have long been an advocate of using technology to improve one’s lifestyle, improve collaboration, and to keep things more or less organized. In most cases, I am a walking solution looking for problems that lack technology.</p>,<p>Yet, I find myself at odds with technology when it comes to making significant strides in my personal and professional goals. I have always required some degree of deep concentration and time to process all that must be juggled. Lately, however, the need is becoming more pronounced.</p>]]></description>

Warren Buffet has some famous rules about not losing money. We should not rely on savings for spending money. Rather savings should working in your favor while you use other financing to get by. All too often, savings is treated as a sort of sinking fund, money set aside to pay off debt or to repurchase a depreciating asset. But, you don’t save money for the purpose of spending it.</p>]]></description>
