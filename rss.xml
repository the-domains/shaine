            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Young, Broke, and Scared of the IRS: The Millennial Tax Trap</h1><p>It wasn't a very nice way to begin a letter, but then, it was from the Internal Revenue Service, and it got Greg's attention. The Athens, Georgia, veteran said the notice, which arrived earlier this year, cited three months of taxes he had failed to pay two years ago-and was the first he'd heard of it.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4b88874733c93e0bf4db2e0b0dfe0c91029b8883.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Why smart people are better off with fewer friends</h1><p>Hell might actually be other people -- at least if you're really smart. That's the implication of fascinating new research published last month in the British Journal of Psychology. Evolutionary psychologists Satoshi Kanazawa of the London School of Economics and Norman Li of Singapore Management University dig in to the question of what makes a life well-lived.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/39f52f2c12afc16968d525d0352a71575b0432df.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Lesson From Automatic Budgeting with Simple Goals</h1><p>In the last couple of posts, I have written about how I am using Simple.com to manage my self-banking experiment. It turns out that one flaw in the process is me. It has become habitual to check balances, transfer money, schedule payments, and figure out strategies to ensure what needs to be paid gets paid.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/6c814ff8e97e900860d0ff1e411789e6d7b99bb0.gif"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Financial Loopholes In Your Brain (and How to Close Them) - Creative Money</h1><p>Financial habits are just as difficult for some people to make and break as any addiction or other bad habit. Yet others can change their habits quite quickly and effectively. Do those people just have more willpower? Are they smarter? Are they somehow than the rest of us? I suspect not.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/6a6538aff48b6299ce7d2fa23c24d8b6c018d5eb.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Shaine Lee Mata</h1><p>In the past few months, I have been experimenting with self-banking. The idea is to have some money saved away, which I can borrow. After borrowing the money, I run it through a 1 year amortization, or longer. Then, I pay back the loan to my savings with interest.</p></article>]]></description>
