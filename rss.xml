            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The New Amazon Echo Dot: One step closer to ubiquitous voice control</h1><p>One thing I love about Star Trek, most of the different series, is the ability to issue voice commands to the ship's computer. The crew is able to use the computer's voice recognition anywhere they go. Amazon has introduced a new and improved Amazon Echo Dot, which is a smaller, stripped down version of the Amazon Echo.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/2b2431f8e7ba7b0/b6c3125b6965a00236da3cbf95b5246d/noop.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2F4.bp.blogspot.com%2F-MJWF0u4BVaA%2FV-GXTDxKJaI%2FAAAAAAABVUQ%2F7RspMaFHDhEr0NhTIbOimBNZM0eXwvnEgCLcB%2Fw1200-h630-p-nu%2Fechotap.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Bringing Dead Blogs Back To Life</h1><p>I have been considering the resurrection of RGV Life and MissionTexas.net recently. These blogs continue to generate a little bit of advertising revenue from Google Adsense every few months despite sitting around without updates. I don't feel any guilt or remorse about leaving the blogs fallow.</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Glacial Financial Growth of my Plan</h1><p>My financial experiments have so far proven more or less workable, although rather slow. In fact, circumstances have led to diminished cash reserves, to the point where I am slightly nervous. I've had some big draws on my reserves that in times past would have been impossible to pay.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/2b2431f8e7ba7b0/386b5c716ec48106de80874ae68283b1/noop.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2F1.bp.blogspot.com%2F-cnXPMwDC_cs%2FV82NUT94NJI%2FAAAAAAABUKI%2FD4UHknfAR_AoWIHdMQqTlZ1PgpZ_QWx-QCLcB%2Fw1200-h630-p-nu%2FIMG_20160905_092539.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The internet as an engine of liberation is an innocent fraud - Nicholas Carr | Aeon Essays</h1><p>It was a scene out of an Ambien nightmare: a jackal with the face of Mark Zuckerberg stood over a freshly killed zebra, gnawing at the animal's innards. But I was not asleep.
