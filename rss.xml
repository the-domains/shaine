            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Self banking is easier with Simple</h1><p>In my last blog post, I wrote about my self banking experiment and a transition to +Simple as my main bank account.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Financial Loopholes In Your Brain (and How to Close Them) - Creative Money</h1><p>Financial habits are just as difficult for some people to make and break as any addiction or other bad habit.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Grid Beta Access: First impression</h1><p>TheGrid.io has granted me Beta access to my account. You can see the account over at ShaineMata.com if you like. If you have never heard of The Grid, they are working to build a self-designing website that uses artificial intelligence. The idea is brilliant. I like the concept.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/9514a4b2017142e3e685f3c1fcf92bc038375344.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Shaine Lee Mata</h1><p>In the past few months, I have been experimenting with self-banking. The idea is to have some money saved away, which I can borrow. After borrowing the money, I run it through a 1 year amortization, or longer. Then, I pay back the loan to my savings with interest.</p></article>]]></description>
