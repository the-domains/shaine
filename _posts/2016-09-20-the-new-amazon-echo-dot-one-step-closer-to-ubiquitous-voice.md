      Amazon Echo is always ready, connected, and fast. Just ask for
      information, music, news, weather, and more. Echo is controlled by your
      voice for hands-free convenience and is connected to the cloud so it's
      always getting smarter. Request an invite at http://amazon.com/echo

  One thing I love about Star Trek, most of the different series, is the ability
  to issue voice commands to the ship's computer. The crew is able to use the
  computer's voice recognition anywhere they go. Amazon has introduced a new and
  improved Amazon Echo Dot, which is a smaller, stripped down version of the
  Amazon Echo.
