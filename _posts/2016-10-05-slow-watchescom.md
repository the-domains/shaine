# Slow Watches For Mindfulness?

<article style=""><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/47df29614469805dbf4e5e408e2ed6c1320be842.jpg" /><h1>slow-watches.com</h1><p>Can a watch change your life? slow: The 24 hour one hand watch. slow is not a speed, it's a mindset that most of us somehow lost. Let's make time to bring slow back into our lives.</p></article>

A promoted tweet by Slow Watches caught my attention. I clicked on the link to find out more about these devices. The idea of a watch with a single hand that goes around once per day is intriguing to me. 

On the one hand, that was a bad pun that slipped out unintentionally, having a Slow Watch would seem to make one extraordinarily unpunctual. After all, if you only know more or less what the time is, it would be difficult to keep appointments. 

However, if you step back and take a broader view, a slow watch would not be so bad. The Slow Watch tells time in increments of 15 minutes. In between those 15 minute minute markings, you are more or less guessing the time. It wouldn't hurt to start preparing a bit early. If you start early, you avoid the last minute rush. 

The only reason you rush at the last minute is because you know you have minute. 

Think how much simpler life would be if you did not try to cram every ounce of productivity out of every minute and every second. If you did worked for effectiveness rather than merely putting in the time. You would make your time count rather than make time run out.

So, in a manner of speaking, by being imprecise, the Slow Watch pushes you towards more meaningful use of your time. Thus, your life is less hurried. You perform better. You enjoy the extra moments of life that you would have otherwise scheduled to the minute. 

I think that not knowing the clear demarcations between one minute and the next is great for mindfulness. If you live from moment to moment without completely losing track of your day, you would have gained a better sense of your day. 

In terms of seeking freedom, the Slow Watch would be very liberating.
