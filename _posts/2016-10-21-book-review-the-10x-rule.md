# Book Review: The 10X Rule

I finished reading _The 10X Rule: The Only Difference Between Success and Failure_ last week. Grant Cardone has done a great job with this book, although at the end it was a bit self-congratulating. I have a ton of highlights through most of the book, however. I think this book is definitely one for your Freedom Library.

I have only recently discovered Grant Cardone. This is the first of his books I have read. I think I may possibly read more of Cardone's books.

I did not realize how much highlighting I did. No wonder it took me so long to read the _The 10X Rule_. I had to do a second reading through my highlights to get a handle of everything that caught my attention. This book reminds me of _The Millionaire Fastlane_ by MJ DeMarco, which I kept having to put down to digest what I was reading.

If I had to distill _The 10X Rule_ down, I would use the following quote from the book:

> You must set targets that are 10 times what you think you want and then do 10 times what you think it will take to accomplish those targets. Massive thoughts must be followed by massive actions.

Of course, there is more to the book than that. Grant Cardone goes through many examples of what people typically do, compared to what should be done, and compared to what he has done in his life. He also goes on to explain why his approach is so effective.

I think you could relate _The 10X Rule_ to another book, _The Magic of Thinking Big_ by David Schwartz. Specifically, if you are going to set a goal, don't set a lame, achievable goal. Instead, you should set a ginormous goal even though you might fail. The reasoning is that if you do succeed, it will be glorious. However, if you fail, you are much better off failing at that big goal than actually achieving your lame little goal.

Once you have this 10X goal, then you will have to step up with actions to achieve the 10X goal rather than your 1X goal, which will be different in effort, scale, planning, and necessary resources. To illustrate, building a birdhouse is roughly the same principle as building a commercial building; but, there is a tremendous difference in the execution.

I definitely recommend _The 10X Rule_ for your Freedom Library for the education and inspiration.
