  I'm a millennial computer scientist who also writes books and runs a blog.
  Demographically speaking I should be a heavy social media user, but that is
  not the case. I've never had a social media account. At the moment, this makes
  me an outlier, but I think many more people should follow my lead and quit
  these services.
