# Book Review: The End of Jobs

I have put off writing about this book, _The End of Jobs_, because I am conflicted about it. I find value in what Taylor Pearson writes. However, I have read many of the same books from which he derives the material written in his book. It is fair to say that _The End of Jobs_ is a derivative work.

The value of reading _The End of Jobs_ would be greatest for somebody who does not read very many business books. However, if you are a reader like me, the book still has some value in the synthesis of ideas aimed at making the overall point that entrepreneurship is the new path to financial well-being that a 9 to 5 career once was. 

Pearson has done a good job of limiting his book to making the argument that the 9 to 5 job is on its way out. Yes, he pulls his information from other publications; but, he uses the information to lay out a case for what the new workforce will face.

Broadly simplified, employers are struggling to afford full-time workers due to arbitrage pressures from foreign talent, automation, and a buyer's market in terms of hiring talent. This leads to an increase in layoffs and an increase in contract workers. The work is still there, it's just that 9 to 5ers are noncompetitive in the traditional setting. 

In addition, technology makes it possible for smaller numbers of people to generate the large amounts of cash that used to require larger, fully staffed companies. An entrepreneur can design and source product to sell via the Internet without needing all the overhead of a traditional company. The design, production, and fulfillment can be outsourced. The marketing and sales are automated via technology. In other words a handful of people can build a business that generates millions of dollars in revenue with low start up capital requirements. More importantly, even if that business fails, it is not costly to scrap it and start over again. 

I think the most important argument Pearson makes in _The End of Jobs_ is that there is a mismatch between education and the changing business environment. Students are being prepared for the 9 to 5 while the business environment is best suited for entrepreneurship and the entrepreneurial mindset. Pearson urges the reader to develop entrepreneurial skills in order to be better prepared for the changing employment market in which every worker is competing on a global scale. 

As a personal aside, I believe that the job market is treating the college degree as debased currency. Colleges and Universities have been churning out diplomas domestically and abroad. Graduates are not just competing locally for jobs, they are competing against billions of people from around the world. 

Entrepreneurship is important not only for people who want to start businesses; it is important for people working within companies as well. The same capacity to cobble together a business from disparate parts serves companies with a smaller workforce. Whereas it may have been less costly for a company to have certain work done in-house in the past, it is making less and less sense today. Rather than push degrees and certifications, businesses are better served by fostering an entrepreneur mindset in their employees. Employee turnover is less destructive if both parties approach the relationship as temporary rather than the old pretense of lifetime employment. 

Ultimately, if you want to be free, you ought to look into entrepreneurship as a career choice. For this reason, I would recommend reading _The End of Jobs_ despite the derivations from other business books. Pearson does a good job of laying out his argument, the job trends, and what it takes to succeed in our evolving economy.
