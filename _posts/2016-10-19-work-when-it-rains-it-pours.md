# Work: When it rains it pours

The good news is that I start a new full-time job soon. This means that I need to finish whatever side jobs I have pending so that I can focus on getting oriented with the new position. I am pending drug test and background check before getting started. 

After leaving my last position, I immediately started getting calls to do IT jobs. I also have a client of ten years who will wait for me to get off work, or will wait for the weekends for me to do a job. He'd rather wait than hire somebody else. So, I've been doing jobs for a little spending money.

Except for this week, the work has not been steady, which is one of the problems I have with self-employment. The unreliable cash flow can be problematic for the freedom-oriented. Unfortunately, there is no way to change this without being booked solid. I suppose being booked solid should be one's goal in order to achieve other goals. Having too much business would spur you to figure out solutions to meet the demand, and would support the overhead costs necessary to pull it off.

But, looping back to the main topic, I start a new full-time job soon and find myself crunched for time to finish jobs I agreed to do while I was "unemployed". I suppose this relates to the cliche of "when it rains, it pours". Self-employment can leave you with periods of little work and then suddenly a deluge. Another cliche is "feast or famine". 

I do freelance IT work between jobs because it's easy money. However, it's not scalable for somebody who is seeking freedom. That means that the business is limited to how many hours I can physically work, and how many hours I want to work. In order to make it work, I would need to be relentless at both marketing and working until I could afford employees. That's a whole other ball of yarn.

I have systematized the business part, such as invoicing, job tracking, mileage recording, and expense tracking. But, the actual work cannot be automated. Somebody has to physically show up, diagnose, and work a solution. There is field service technician software available that allows for dispatching employees, job tracking, billing, and everything necessary so that workers can go from job to job without having to report to the shop.

But, I only have a couple days remaining. There is not enough time to start my IT empire alongside my writing empire, blogging empire, and investing empire on top of starting a new job. To quote Jaqen H'ghar from Game of Thrones: 
> 
> A man can only wear one face at a time. 

That's a totally made up quote, but within the spirit of the character. In other words, I need to be selective with my time, which in itself is a small measure of freedom. One does not have to take every opportunity, only the best ones.
