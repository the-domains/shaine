# Winding Down
![IDF at CEED building](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/62e95281-0925-4644-b480-8f3567b65069.jpg)

After many weeks, many days, many hours, our project is near its end. Baptism by fire is a good education, although probably not the ideal education.

I look forward to more adventures and the work ahead.
