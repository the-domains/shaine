  One of the most annoying things in life is to be stuck in a loop. This used to
  be called being stuck in a rut. I disagree with the description. You create a
  rut from walking or driving the same path over and over. Despite the negative
  association, a rut is the result of purpose.

The loop in which I am stuck is a behavioral routine in which I am going in circles. There is no purpose to the routine. Thus, breaking out of the loop will not affect anything of importance. Yet, behavioral routines can be difficult to break. These routines are often embedded in other useful routines. Once you start on one, it is very easy to unwittingly slip into the other. There is so much comfort in doing the same things over and over, even when they do not serve you for the better.

I need to get out of this funk. It is sapping my motivation and creativity.
