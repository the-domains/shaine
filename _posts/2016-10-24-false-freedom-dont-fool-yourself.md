You work hard, make money, establish systems, and do everything possible to create a future built around your freedom. It turns out that freedom is subjective; it is different for everybody. So, I started thinking about what freedom is not and how some freedom can be false. So, let's talk about false freedom.

# False Freedom: Don't fool yourself

Let me give you a quick example of a false freedom. What would you do if you were financially independent and did not have to work? Typical answers are travel, spend time with family, volunteer, or other activities like taking our kids to the park every day. We can relate, right? Work takes up a lot of our time that we could devote to do those things that we love.

However, most of us are not working 80 to 90 hour workweeks. We are working 40 hours per week, more or less. We have a few hours here and there to devote to our interests, whether it be painting, blogging, volunteering, or taking your kids to the park. Perhaps we cannot do these things full-time. However, we can still do those things to some degree.

Spending time with family is perhaps the dream of many hard working people looking forward to retirement or working towards financial independence. However, we could do the same thing without money. We could play games together, go for a snow cone, go to the park, cook together, do laundry together, or just plain goof off together. It is simply a decision to deliberately spend time together rather than wait for a magical day to roll around. That magical day is false freedom. We already have the freedom to do these things.

There are some dreams that do require money, obviously. Travel costs transportation, lodging, and dining. However, these costs are the same whether we are living in one location or we are travelling. If we are working a 9 to 5 job, we are still spending money on transportation, lodging, and meals. However, we may have made these costs higher than they need to be. Every dollar extra dollar spent on staying put is a dollar that could have gone to travelling.

For example, when we travel, we are perfectly content to sleep in a hotel or motel room with a bag or two of belongings. Why is this different in our residence? If our goal is to travel, then things such as furniture, decorations, equipment, and other things most of us keep in our homes are a drag on the dream. These items require paying a premium for the space to store them. That storage cost could go to travel. If all we possess fits in a backpack, we could sleep in a motel, a couch, a tent, or on the bus to our next destination. How much travel could we achieve for the price of a house, taxes, utilities, maintenance, and the extra expenses of owning a home?

We often have a fantasy about what freedom is without realizing that it is staring us in the face. I think part of the reason we do not recognize freedom is because we expect it to be packaged and labeled, like a vacation package. We typically have the means to the freedom we seek within our reach, if we only take it.

We fail to find freedom because we cling to things that inherently anchor us down. Then, we dream up ideals of freedom that are false. If we never spend time with family during our working years, having had them with us every evening and on weekends, then we will likely not spend time with them upon retirement. Whatever we spent our time doing during working years such as chores, watching TV, reading trashy novels, or whatever, we will continue to do more of when we no longer have to work. That freedom we desired was just an illusion because we did not know how to take advantage of the little freedom we had.

My point is that we should not wait until we "achieve freedom" to pursue our dreams. We may very well discover that there is nothing there waiting for us.

Someday freedom is a false freedom. Our everyday life gives us time to enjoy those things that make us feel free and happy. If we cannot enjoy our freedom in small tidbits, then we will not know how to enjoy our freedom in unlimited quantities. Having said all that, I think our goal should be to have more of those real freedoms we already enjoy every day rather than the false freedom of tomorrow.
