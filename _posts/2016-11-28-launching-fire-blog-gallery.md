# Launching FIRE Blog Gallery

I have just launched [FIRE Blog Gallery][0], a website about personal finance and things related to Financial Independence and Retire Early. The site is a way for me to share some of my favorite posts about personal finance and business.

Prior to the FIRE Blog Gallery, I had been publishing links on my personal blog, which didn't seem right in that my own writing got buried among other posts. So, by giving myself a place to share, it allows me to focus this site on my own writing.

The posts that I share will be ones that have significance to me and my philosophies on money and wealth. With any luck, my favorite posts will also strike a chord with some readers.
