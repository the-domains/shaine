# Transition to Writing

Originally, I had intended to become a self-supporting writer with the purpose, firstly, of becoming self-supporting. I see writing as the ultimate home-based business. I imagine myself secluded in a corner somewhere with coffee and a laptop banging away on the QWERTY, making money.

Another purpose for becoming a writer was in service of my wanderlust. Writing is one of those professions that can be done just about anywhere, and can find inspiration from new surroundings, new people, and new ideas. If I could work from anywhere in the world, why not work anywhere in the world?

Up to now, this writing thing has been a flirtation, perhaps even a dalliance. But, as in so many things, in requires setting aside time to devote to the craft. I have hit somewhat of a wall bringing my blogs the life. This has been primarily due to not setting aside the necessary time and lacking a system to churn out work. Each piece is takes entirely too long to write.

I have, however, not been wasting my time. In fact, much time is invested in reading things such as developing stories and characters, along with blogs. I must be careful to not spend so much time learning to write that I never actually get around do writing.

I think I can accept some degree of lousy writing so long as I develop the discipline of cranking out text. I can improve quality in time.

One of my discoveries has been that novels typically have about 80,000 words. That is a ton of writing, rewriting, and dedication. It demands a systematic approach.

One reason my body bears no tattoos, a really good reason, is that I would not be able to edit the work. What is meaningful to me one day may be of little consequence the next. I could not commit to ink in such a way.

In terms of writing, without a systematic approach, I would drive myself crazy with infinite rewrites before hitting the publish button. In other words, I would likely never publish.

Being more systematic would result in clearly defined goals and milestones in the narrative. I could comfortably hit Publish on work that meets my standards, even if it lacks polish.

So, it is near the time to remove the training wheels and begin my wobbly adventure. There is time for theory and time for doing.
