# Making adjustments

On the wayto major life changes, I got an opportunity to take a course on Photography. This is new ground for me. Most of my studies have been in science, business, and technology. The only exception was that voice class I took my freshman year at University.

I say that this detour is new because I feel like a fish out of water. There are words I do not understand, which is entirely new in itself.

I think my biggest fear is discovering that I've been overthinking what it means to be a photographer. On the one hand it would be liberating to know I have what it takes. On the other hand, it would be an indictment on my failure to push on.

All that aside, I think I should enjoy the coming weeks and the demands of learning about the art of photography.
