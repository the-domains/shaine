# New website: ComputerRepairMissionTX.com

I spent yesterday and this morning throwing together a lead generation website to bring me some computer repair business. You can check it out at [ComputerRepairMissionTX.com][0] to see the work in progress.

I have been in and out of the tech business over so many years.

I have had a personal blog, community websites, and have been active all over social media.

NEVER did it occur to me to create a lead-generation website for myself. I have relied on word of mouth advertising and networking events to keep me employed. It has worked well-enough; but, not great.

In a moment of profound insight, I started putting the pieces together for bringing in new customers via a website. Running a personal site like this one covers so many topics, that it is not easy for prospects to know exactly what it is I do.

In this case, the new website is very simple in its scope. This is how it ought to be.

In this case, the website just needs to generate leads.

Now comes the part where I need to gather traffic. I'm hoping to be on page one of search results for my town in a couple weeks.
