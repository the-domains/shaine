# The Trouble With Freedom

The theme for this period in my life is "Seeking Freedom". Instinctively, I know that this is something I want. Cognitively, I do not fully grasp what that means. Being Free is turning out to be a great more difficult than I thought. The problem is choosing one of many paths.

So the big questions are:

* Freedom from what?
* Freedom to do what?
* What keeps me from being free today?
* How will I know when I am free?
* How do I get from here to there?

The trouble with freedom, besides not having it, is what do we do with it when we have it?

When we have little freedom to choose a path, we take whatever path lies before us, such as taking the only job offer after months of unemployment. We have the choice of making a path of our own; but that measure is typically takes by a few brave souls who are very clear on where they need to go.

And what happens when we see many paths before us, all divergent, all equally challenging, and all more or less equally rewarding?

How do we choose?

I find myself thinking of what purpose my freedom will serve. Certainly, freedom was not meant for us to stand paralyzed with indecision?

If we stand still long enough, the paths will become overgrown and fade until one or none are apparent.

Was the purpose of freedom simply to have to luxury of watching opportunities fade away or to be left behind?

No, I get the feeling that whatever path we choose, more will converge up ahead. Some will lead back to places we could have gone at the last fork. Some will lead to entirely new places that couldn't be reached from the previous fork.

I am reminded of Cheshire Cat:

> If you don't know where you are going, any road will get you there.

And so, without purpose for our freedom, any road will do.

Your purpose, and mine, could be to spend more time with family, to not worry about money, to travel to world, or some combination of those.

With purpose, our potential paths begin to differentiate by their capacity to lead us to our purpose.

Whereas having no purpose for our freedom results in a paradox of choice. Having a purpose, on the other hand, can result in having only one choice. The right choice.

How is this different from those who are stuck on a path they did not choose? The difference is purpose.

Every day we wake up with new paths before us, but we stick to the familiar one hoping some purpose will reveal itself in the future if we walk far enough.

Truly, we must have a purpose to eliminate our freedom to choose. Our purpose will dictate which way to turn.

Everything we do must serve our purpose. We need to be crystal clear what that purpose is lest we spend our lives serving somebody else's. Clarity of purpose is our north star in life.
