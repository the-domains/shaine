# Seeking Freedom To Do What?

One challenge to seeking freedom is figuring out to what purpose? What does it look like and how do you get it? I have discovered that storytelling is one way to find freedom. How would you characterize yourself if you were the protagonist in your own story?

One can find inspiration in the strangest places. I have been reading _How to Write a Novel Using the Snowflake Method _by Randy Ingermanson. In one of the sections, Randy writes about developing characters for a novel. You must know the character's values, ambitions, and goals.

Up until now, I was thinking about this in regard to developing characters for a novel I am writing. However, character development seems oddly appropriate for developing my own character and writing my own story, which culminates in the main character, me, finding freedom. So, let us illustrate with my character. 

What are my values?

What is my overall ambition?

What are my goals with respect to achieving those two?

### Values

In a story, a character may value things like honor, respect, cleanliness, wealth, punctuality, piousness, fun, or any number of things. Conflict in a story is not always because characters dislike each other; rather, characters may have conflicting values. Or perhaps characters have common values in which they work together to achieve great things. 

Off hand, I would say that I would value family, time and money. However, I started thinking that I spend my time to get money. And, I also spend time and money on my family. Do I value time at all if I am so willing to spend it on the other values? It seems there is a conflict in my values, which makes for an interesting character in books.

To me, time is extremely important. Because of the way I am, I require time to process life. I am happiest having a few hours alone to think, plan, and explore ideas. With time, I can be deliberate and effective. Ironically, I need to spend time alone so that I can more tolerably spend time with both my family and work. The Shaine Mata character needs alone time to decompress and contemplate. Without that time, everything is a blur and pointless. 

Time conflicts with my next value, money, because I need money to buy time. But, the only thing I have of value to exchange for money is time. One could argue that I have talents; but, these talents still require time to use. The reason why money is of value to me is that I can take it to buy time. With money, I can pay somebody to mow the lawn, pay for utilities rather than carrying my own water or cranking my own electricity, or pay for gas in my car to get me across town rather than walk. It is not the possessions I can buy that I value, it is the time these items save me. Money also pays for some pleasures like books and travel.

With regards to family, I can deduce that they are of great value to me because I spend my two other values, time and money, on them. I do not value time or money to the exclusion of family. Rather, I value family as a basic need for a happy life, even if in limited quantities.

Your character may have more than three values, which I limited here for the sake of illustration. Think about what you value. And, be prepared to have some personal values that may be in conflict. 

### Ambition

Perhaps this is where we reconcile the conflicting values. My overall ambition is to be financially independent so that I can have time to devote to my personal interests and to my family. Therefore, everything I do must serve that ambition of financial independence. 

Your ambition could be different. You may want to change the lives of your community, to be a rock star, to help the poor, to party harder than any of your friends, or to rule the world. 

Ultimately, our ambition is our driving motivation for who we are and what we do. Ambition is forward-looking and derives from those things we value. 

### Goals

And so that brings us to setting specific goals for the character of me. What can Shaine Mata do, specifically, with respect to pursuing the ambition of achieving financial freedom?

Some goals might include buying assets with cash flow, reading books about business and finance, controlling spending, better control of time, budgeting, or picking up side gigs. 

What can your character do, specifically, to achieve your ambitions? This is a great exercise because it helps us match our actions with our ambitions.

### The End Result

The end result of this exercise in turning myself into a character for a novel is that my story almost writes itself. Plop my character into any scenario and you could guess how I would respond based on my values, ambition, and goals. More importantly, being clear about these same items helps us, as the characters of our novels, to navigate life as it unfolds before us. 

As with any novel, a character's values, ambitions, or goals might change. We may find that we need to make adjustments to our own character from time to time. Our values at age 18 may be very different from our values at age 45\. Therefore, we would take action based on our changing values rather than out of custom or habit. 

Having clarity of purpose makes it easier to cut out things that no longer serve where our character is going. Just as an avid runner might give up smoking to improve his performance, your character may have some habits that no longer serve your purpose. 

Thinking of oneself as a character in a novel helps shed light on what drives us to do or not do certain things. In your life story, you get to decide what what is in character and what is out of character. By knowing who you are, you have complete freedom to only be yourself rather than be who others think you should be. It's your story to be told by your actions in any way you want.
