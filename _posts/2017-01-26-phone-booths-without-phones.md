# Phone Booths Without Phones

Yesterday, my attention at work was overseeing the installation of two phone booths without phones.

It seems anachronistic that in the day of mobile phones that anybody would use a phone booth. The reality is that sometimes you need some privacy or a little bit of quiet.

Phone booths, if you think about it, also created a clear separation in your attention. If you were on a call with somebody in a phone booth, your focus was on the call.

These days, people wander around flagellating their arms and avoiding eye contact when in an important phone conversation. They purposely focus their attention on the call while trying to ignore everybody else. They walk around like zombies while everybody else avoids them as such. 

I think more buildings should have phone booths for their occupants. We could all use a small place of isolation from the world for a few moments.
